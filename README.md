# File-Sorting-Tool
**Python Automation Project**

Idea behind it: Got eye strain and literal nausea from how unorganised and overflowing my Downloads folder was looking, so I wanted a simple sorting tool that I can run in background whenever I download something or drag a file into the Download folder, creates sorting folder if they don't exist. So in the end, eye strain cured and nausea has ceased.

Developed a Python-based automation tool to streamline the process of organising and relocating files by type into designated folders using Watchdog. Implemented duplicate detection and automatic renaming to maintain directory coherence.
